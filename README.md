# Project Title: open_code
Overview
Welcome to open_code! This AI language model is designed to make discoveries and try to understand what people say and actually use them.
This AI model is not exactly the best, (probably because I am not a master at Python) but it is impressive to say the least. It won't have advanced sentences like that of ChatGPT. Definitely.
It is a good challenging project for me and some peers since, I have not coded in so long. This will definitely get me back on track.

# Features
Natural Language Understanding: It will be capable of understanding basic statements, interrogative, and exclamatory sentences.
Generation Capabilities: As of 12/20/23. There is still a couple of words in a text document as a placeholder. It is still in the works, but I definitely am making it learn what you are saying in order to converse.
Customization Options: You can alter the way the model reacts with just some simple code.

# Getting Started
To start using open_code, follow these steps:

Installation: If you would like to install my language model, you can check out a website to install it. Once the model is complete I will put the link here for installation.
Usage: If you'd actually want to use this, feel free and go ahead. This is a simple personal project and if you'd like to test it out and give feedback. I'd gladly allow you to do it.
Options and Parameters: There are none as of now.

# I HOPE YOU LOVE THE IDEA!
See you!
